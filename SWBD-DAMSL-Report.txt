Assignment 3 Report

Name: Xin Ge

1. If you included files other than baseline_crf.py, advanced_crf.py, evaluate_model.py, and hw3_corpus_tool.py, or modified hw3_corpus_tool.py please describe what the files do and/or your modifications to hw3_corpus_tool.py.

split_data.py, to split the data into two categories, train and dev.

2. Describe how you evaluated your baseline and advanced features

Replace this text with a description of how you used the labeled data
to train and evaluate different models (e.g., moving ~25% data into a
separate development directory).


(2)Evaluate models:
Because evaluate_model.py has two parameters:
1. dev directory 2. the output file of the model
In addition, I have added a optional paramter to test two output files, but the way of evaluate is the same.

Precision = num_of_correctly_classified_utterances / sum_of_utterances 

In order to know how many utterances are correctly labeled, I need to read the dev data, get the label and compare.
Rather than read the file name from output.txt, I choose to sort the file by name. Because all the files in dev folder are read in the same sorted order.

Then the program knows the relationship between files and tags, and can calculate utterances that are correctly labeled. And after that, print the precision.

3. Describe your advanced feature set.

4. If you tried alternate advanced feature sets, please describe them.

5. Accuracy of baseline features was: 0.7184135230780815
6. Accuracy of advanced features was: 0.7340373465853475
